# Containerizing rt-app for Real Time Testing

Welcome to my sample container build for the rt-app.

**Goal**: Document the process for building a RHEL 9 container that contains the rt-app.

## What Is rt-app?

rt-app is a test application that starts multiple periodic threads in order to
simulate a real-time periodic load.
